    "content" : "The Ultimate Guide to Hamster Food: What to Feed Your Pet Explore balanced diets and tasty treats for your rodent pet By LIANNE MCLEOD, DVM Updated on 05/30/25 Reviewed by NATASHA DIEHL Credit: The Spruce / Adrienne Legault KEY TAKEAWAYS The ideal diet for a hamster includes a balance of pelleted food, seed mixes, fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, nuts, and protein. There are specific foods that should never be fed to hamsters, such as almonds, citrus fruits, and chocolate. Hamsters require fresh fruits and vegetables, comprising about 20% of their diet, to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Hamsters are cute, small, and relatively easy to care for. If socialized and handled gently, they can be quite affectionate. As such, they are popular pocket pets. Like any pet, however, it's crucial to choose the right food to keep your hamster healthy and happy. Providing proper nutrition throughout all life stages is essential. In the wild, hamsters are omnivores, meaning that they eat both plant materials and the occasional insect for protein. They often tuck food into their cheek pouches, which makes it easy to carry food back to their burrow for safe consumption. Of course, it's undeniably adorable to see your pet hamster with its cheek pouches stuffed full, which is an instinctive behavior even in the safety of a cage. Hamster food can be a mix of pellets, seed mixes, fresh foods, and treats. The majority of your pet's diet should be made up of a good quality, store-bought food designed specifically for hamsters (not for rats, mice, or cats). But food choices at the pet store can be overwhelming, even after narrowing it down to hamster food. The decisions don't end when you get home and want to offer fresh foods and treats to your pet. Here's what you should know about hamster food, including the commercial products and fresh foods to feed your pet hamster, as well as some foods to avoid. Essential Guide to Hamsters as Pets Pelleted Hamster Food One of the easiest ways to feed your hamster is with pelleted foods. Pelleted hamster foods offer a completely balanced diet in every bite, and they are often recommended for this reason. Pelleted diets can come in many shapes but usually look like small biscuits, cookies, or cereal. Most hamsters enjoy chewing on them, and pellets prevent a hamster from being choosy and picking through the food to find favorites while rejecting less-liked foods, something that's often a problem with seed mixes. However, a diet that's entirely made up of pellets is a bit monotonous and some hamsters will eventually refuse them. To prevent that from happening, and to provide your pet with a well-rounded diet, use pellets as the main base of your hamster food, but supplement with other, tastier foods as well. Always read the package for feeding directions, but generally, your hamster should be offered a few tablespoons of pellets each day. Adding Seeds to Hamster Food Hamsters love a mixture of seeds, but tend to pick through to find their favorites and may reject the rest. For this reason, it can be best to feed your hamster a diet that combines pellets and loose seeds, or choose a seed blend that includes some pellets. A good hamster seed mix has several ingredients, including grains, seeds, and dried vegetables or fruits. Most also have added vitamins and minerals. When feeding a loose seed mix, make sure your hamster empties the food bowl before adding more, rather than allowing your hamster to eat only its favorite things, which can lead to a nutritional deficit. And be sure the seed mix is formulated for hamsters (many such products are for both hamsters and gerbils), not for other types of rodents or for birds. Follow the package guidelines, but as a general rule, you can offer around 1/8-cup of seed mix each day. Fresh Hamster Food Hamsters love fresh vegetables and fruits. As a rough guideline, your hamster's diet should be made up of around 75% pellets and seeds, 20% fresh foods, and only 5% treats. Feed your pet small bits of fresh, clean produce each day. Wash the food before offering it, and remove any uneaten foods by the end of the day so it doesn't spoil. Some of the best fresh foods include greens, such as kale, dandelion greens, romaine lettuce, Swiss chard, and raw spinach. Fresh fruit is a definite favorite, but don't go overboard with the sweet stuff, as your pet can become overweight. Liven up your pet's diet a few times each week with small offerings of apples, bananas, berries, grapes, and melons. Stay away from citrus, however. Your hamster should have a small \"salad\" of fresh vegetables each day as well. Some especially good offerings include bites of carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, peas, squash, and cooked potatoes (other vegetables should be raw) Hamster Food: Grains, Nuts and Protein While the bulk of your hamster's food should be pellets, seeds, and fresh produce, you should also offer small bites of other foods each week to provide a diet more similar to what your pet would eat in the wild, as well as stave off boredom. Most hamsters enjoy snacking on whole grains in the form of bits of whole-grain toast, whole-grain cereals, cooked pasta, and cooked rice. Avoid sugary cereals or breads with added sugar. Like most rodents, hamsters also like nuts, but these should be offered no more than once per week, and only one or two small nuts per feeding. Give your pet only unsalted nuts, including peanuts, cashews, and walnuts. No almonds, however, which are not good for hamsters. Hamsters also usually love peanut butter, but it must be fed carefully (as with any other sticky food) since it can get stuck in their cheek pouches and cause severe problems. A very thin layer on a piece of wood is okay as an occasional treat, but peanut butter must be given with caution. Choose peanut butter without added salt and sugar. Like other rodents, hamsters need protein in their diets, and they do enjoy non-plant-based proteins on occasion. You can give your hamster an occasional treat of a bite or two of scrambled or hard-boiled egg, dried mealworms or crickets, or plain, cooked chicken or turkey.

There is no need for commercial treats if you feed your pet the above foods, as the extras are more than enough \"treat\" for your hamster. Of course, your hamster should always have access to fresh, clean water. FAQ How long can a hamster go without food? You should feed your hamster daily and remove uneaten food from its cage every day, as well. Never starve your pet or leave it too long without access to food and water. A hamster can only live three or four days without food, but should never have to suffer that long. How much does hamster food cost? Because hamsters only eat very small quantities of food each day, it doesn't cost much to keep your pet rodent healthy, well fed, and happy. A bag of hamster pellets or seed only costs a few dollars and will feed your pet for a long time. And you should be able to provide fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, nuts, and protein from your own pantry or refrigerator. How much food should I feed a hamster? Hamsters don't eat a lot of food at any one time. Generally, your pet won't eat more than 1/8-cup of food in a day. However, always read the package when feeding your pet a commercial pellet or seed diet, and use the manufacturer guidelines for filling your hamster's food dish. Additional foods, including fresh produce and grains, should only make up a small portion of your hamster's diet.

    "content" : "DIET & HEALTH | HAMSTERS Safe & Unsafe Hamster Food List: Veggies, Fruits, Nuts, Seeds, Herbs, Protein & More By Monika Kucic Updated on July 18, 2023 Hamsters are such delicate little creatures, and feeding them something that is not good for them can easily harm their health and well-being. The good news is that fresh food for hamsters is not all that complicated, and they can safely eat more foods than cats and dogs. To make it easier for you, we’ve compiled a list of safe veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds, flowers, herbs, protein and grain – so pretty much everything you need to know! There’s also a list of unsafe foods and foods you should feed in moderation. This list is for all hamster species. Subscribe to our newsletter on our sign up form or here and access our library of free printables, including the “Safe & Unsafe Hamster Food List”! You can print it out and keep it close by for easy reference. Let’s get started! Table of Contents How to Feed Fresh Food to Hamsters Fresh foods such as vegetables and greens should make a small addition to your hamster’s regular diet. You can feed a few different vegs and herbs a couple of times a week or even one small piece of veg daily. A general guide for serving is the size of your hamster’s ear. Introduce any new foods slowly, so your hamster doesn’t get an upset stomach. If the food is causing a “wet tail,” i.e., diarrhea or an adverse reaction of any kind, stop feeding it. Hamsters tend to hoard their food, and since fresh foods go rancid quickly, remove any uneaten veg and fruit pieces on the same day you give them. Also, check your hamster’s stash to ensure they didn’t hide any of it. Safe Vegetables List for Hamsters Arugula Ginger Artichoke Green Beans Asparagus Kale Beet Mushroom Bell Pepper Parsnip Bok Choy Peas Broccoli Potato (cooked) Brussels Sprouts Pumpkin Cabbage Radicchio Carrot Romaine Lettuce Cauliflower Soybeans Celery Snow Peas Collards Spinach Corn Squash Cucumber Sweet Potato (cooked) Edamame Swiss Chard Endive Zucchini Fennel Hamsters can safely eat a wide variety of veggies, but there are some rules to follow. Green, raw potatoes contain large amounts of a toxin called solanine, so hamsters, like humans, should never eat such potatoes. Potatoes should be fed cooked, without salt or seasoning. Garlic and onion have been an object of debate in the hamster-keeping community. Hamsters can eat cooked garlic and onion, and it even has some health benefits for them! You can read more about the research on garlic and onion for hamsters here. But as with everything, moderation is key. Veggies that you should avoid as they are not safe are: Chili Peppers (and other hot peppers) Eggplant (Aubergine) Uncooked Broad and Kidney beans or other beans high in lectin Although not necessarily vegetables, beans are most often grouped that way. It’s important to remember that some types of beans, such as Broad and Kidney beans, are toxic for humans and hamsters when raw. You should always cook those beans before feeding them to your hamster. Green beans, on the other hand, are safe to feed raw as they don’t contain high amounts of lectin as broad and kidney beans. Safe Fruits List for Hamsters Campbell’s (including hybrids) and Chinese hamsters have a high susceptibility to diabetes, and while eating fruit will not directly cause diabetes, it can exacerbate the risk of developing the condition for hamsters already predisposed to it. That’s why it is recommended to only feed them tiny amounts of fruit occasionally or avoid feeding it altogether. In their natural habitat, these hamsters do not typically eat sugary foods. While Syrian hamsters are not prone to diabetes as dwarf species, you should still not feed them fruits in excess. Acai Kiwi Apple (no seeds) Kumquat Apricot Lychee Banana Mango Blackberries Nectarines Blueberries Papaya Boysenberries Passion Fruit Cantaloupe Peach (no pit) Cherries (no pit) Pear Cranberries Pineapple Currants Plum (no pit) Dates Pomegranate Elderberries Raspberry Figs Starfruit Gooseberries Strawberries Grapes (no seeds) Tomatoes (ripe) Guava Watermelon Honeydew Melon Avocado flesh can be fed but in moderation, because it is high in fat. However, you should never feed avocado pit, skin, or leaves as they are toxic to hamsters. Citrus fruits are another fruit family often perceived as unsafe due to being highly acidic. Also, research has found that citrus fruits can cause kidney tumors in male rats when fed in substantial quantities. But there is no evidence that citrus fruits are not safe for hamsters – research found that they can even be beneficial. Of course, you shouldn’t give your hamster large quantities of any fruits, including citrus, as they are high in sugar. But the occasional citrus treat is entirely safe for your Syrian hamster. When it comes to tomatoes, it’s essential to keep in mind that you should only feed ripe tomatoes without leaves or stems as they are toxic. Also, avoid the pits and seeds of some fruits (mentioned in the fruit list above) because they contain amygdalin which is converted into cyanide in the stomach and may cause toxicity in large doses. Nuts & Legumes Almonds Hazelnuts Black Eyed Peas Lentils Cashews Peanuts Chickpeas Split Peas Coconut Walnuts Nuts should be unflavored and unsalted. Almonds often end up on the “unsafe hamster food” lists because people confuse bitter almonds with human-grade almonds. Bitter almonds are not safe for hamsters or humans due to a toxic chemical called hydrogen cyanide. But human-grade almonds, which we humans eat, are perfectly safe for hamsters too. Although nuts make excellent treats, being fun and enriching, you should still be mindful of the quantities you feed them as nuts are high in calories and fat content, so they are not something you want to give every day. Seeds Chia Seeds Pumpkin Seeds Flax Seeds Sesame Seeds Hemp Seeds Sunflower Seeds Like nuts, seeds should also be unflavored and unsalted. Here’s a page from our “Safe & Unsafe Hamster Food List” printable that all our subscribers get for easy reference. You can get access to the printable by subscribing to our newsletter at the bottom of this post or here. Herbs & Flowers Basil Nettle Calendula Oregano Chamomile Parsley Cornflowers Raspberry Leaves Dandelion Rose Petals Dill Sunflower Petals Hibiscus Petals Thyme Marigold Leaves Herbs and flowers make a great addition to your hamster’s diet. They are excellent for foraging and enrichment. You can use fresh culinary kitchen herbs and dried herbs. Grains Amaranth Oat Flakes Barley Popped Corn Buckwheat Quinoa Bulgur Wheat Rice Corn Flakes (plain) Rye Flakes Couscous Wheat Germ Millet Grains make up a large portion of your pet’s diet. They are served in a dry food mix you give to your hamster, but you can add a little bit of your own as a treat from time to time. Protein Cheese Cooked Plain Chicken Cottage Cheese Cooked Plain Turkey Crickets Cooked Plain Beef Eggs Salmon Grasshoppers Tofu Mealworms Yogurt Hamsters often get mistaken for herbivores, but they are actually omnivores, so having animal protein in their diet is essential. The most natural sources of protein for them are mealworms, crickets, and grasshoppers, as those insects are similar to what hamsters would eat in the wild, but you can also offer other protein foods such as cooked, unseasoned meat or eggs. Keep in mind that cooked beef should not be fed often because it’s high in cholesterol. Chicken is a much healthier choice for hamsters. In Moderation Some foods are not very healthy for hamsters because of their high fat or sugar content. Feed the following foods in moderation only: Avocado – This fruit is very high in fat, so it should only be fed occasionally and in small quantities. Beef – This type of meat is high in cholesterol compared to other meats, so it should not be the primary protein source for your hamster. Dairy products, i.e., cheese, yogurt – Dairy is too high in fat to be fed often. Dried fruits – Dried fruits have a much higher concentration of natural sugars than fresh fruit, so they shouldn’t be fed often or in large quantities. Best to avoid altogether for diabetes-prone dwarf hamsters. Garlic & onion – These veggies are fine to offer when cooked into other foods, but best to avoid raw. High-fat foods such as coconut and other nuts. Hamster treats such as Yogurt Drops and other sugary treats. What Can Hamsters Not Eat? Unsafe Foods Hamsters can eat a wide variety of foods. If a human can eat it, it’s most likely fine for a hamster too. But some foods are a strict “no” for hamsters: Uncooked Broad and Kidney beans and a few others – Broad, Kidney beans and some others contain a high amount of toxin called lectin, which makes them poisonous when raw. Beans that humans can’t eat raw shouldn’t be fed raw to hamsters, either. Packaged meats such as deli or canned meats are not healthy for hamsters. Chili Peppers or any hot pepper. Moldy cheeses such as Blue Cheese should be avoided. Eggplant (Aubergine) should be avoided as it contains high amounts of solanine. This alkaloid is toxic if eaten in large amounts. Raw potato – Hamsters, as well as humans, should not eat raw, green potatoes due to their toxicity. Rhubarb leaves – They are toxic to hamsters. We’ve gathered the data for this hamster food list from the most reputable sources and double-checked everything to make sure the list is completely accurate. There are many hamster food lists shared around the internet, but not many are backed by science. Instead, they are created with “word of mouth” information which is often false. We wanted to create a go-to place for hamster owners to get the correct data.

View 4 More + Nutrition is an essential factor when keeping your pet hamster healthy. Feeding time can also be great for bonding as well, but what can—and can’t—they eat? What Foods Can Hamsters Eat? Hamsters are omnivores, which means they can eat both plant and animal matter. Since they are domesticated, most of their protein comes from commercialized pellet diets that have been formulated to give them a well-rounded diet. Hamsters can also eat fresh vegetables as part of their daily diet, Some that you can offer are: Leafy greens Colored peppers, such as bell peppers Cucumbers Carrots (only as occasional treats, as they have a high sugar content) Make sure to give your hamster baby carrots chopped into small pieces to prevent choking. You can also offer fruits and seeds to your hamster as treats on occasion, such as: Apples Bananas Strawberries (if your hamster has a light fur color, be aware that strawberries may temporarily stain their fur) Sunflower seeds (without salt or added flavors) What Foods Can’t Hamsters Eat? Although hamsters are omnivores, they should not eat live prey. Hamsters like storing their food, and live prey can injure your hamster or infest their environment. It’s OK to feed freeze-dried mealworms to your hamster, but it should be optional as part of their daily diet, as all the protein they need should come from their pellet diet. Hamsters are omnivores, which means they can eat both plant and animal matter. Often, hamsters may not even consume the freeze-dried prey, so offering a different treat to your hamster, like sunflower seeds, may be better.

Human food, other than fresh, uncooked vegetables, and some fruits should be avoided as they may be unsafe for your hamster. Hamsters should not eat a mainly seed-based diet, as it can lead to obesity or malnutrition. The Ideal Diet For Hamsters Let's take a look at the ideal diet for your pet hamster. Pellets Commercial pellets should be the central part of your hamster’s diet. These pellets have been formulated to give your hamster a well-rounded diet. Since every diet is formulated differently, it’s best to follow the manufacturer’s guide on how much to feed your hamster.  Treats When feeding treats to your hamster, it’s essential to factor in that they are part of your hamster’s daily needed calories. Feeding too many treats can lead to obesity and even malnutrition from not having enough of the correct nutrients. Treats include seeds, fresh fruit, or even commercialized treats like freeze-dried fruit.  Recommended Products Oxbow Essentials Healthy Handfuls Gerbil & Hamster Food Rated 4.4 out of 5 stars 225 Reviews $5.99 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy Oxbow Simple Rewards Freeze-Dried Banana Small Animal Treats Rated 4.6 out of 5 stars 463 Reviews $5.19 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy Vegetables Fresh vegetables can be offered to your hamster daily. Iceberg lettuce, which has very little nutritional value, should be avoided along with spicy and citrus foods. Dandelion greens, spinach, and romaine lettuce can be offered to your hamster, along with pieces of cucumber, colored peppers, and other vegetables cut into bite-sized pieces.  These can be offered daily, but do not offer every vegetable daily. Offer them on alternating days because primarily the pelleted diet should be 90% of your hamster’s daily diet. Fruit When it comes to fruit, moderation is key. While fresh fruit can be a tasty addition to your hamster's diet, it's important to remember that fruits are high in sugar. Avoid citrus fruits and always remove seeds and pits before feeding them to your hamster. This is because many fruit seeds and pits can contain components that can lead to arsenic poisoning in small pets. Seeds Seeds can be a part of your hamster's diet, but they should not be the main component. Seeds are high in fat and low in other nutrients, and this can lead to obesity or malnutrition. To avoid these issues, it's best to offer a variety of foods. Non-seasoned or flavored sunflower seeds can be a great occasional treat for your hamster! Hay Like other rodents, hamsters can eat clean, fresh hay, such as timothy hay. However, hamsters do not require it as part of their diet. If you decide to feed your hamster hay, ensure it is free of dust, moisture, and mold.  Recommended Products Small Pet Select First Cut Timothy Hay Small Animal Food Rated 4.3 out of 5 stars 322 Reviews $16.99 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy Why Understanding Your Hamster’s Dietary Needs Is Important Knowing what to feed your hamster is a vital part of having one as a family pet. One of the most common causes of illness is husbandry problems and poor nutrition. Obesity can be a relatively common problem for hamsters, which can lead to diseases like diabetes. Even obese hamsters may be suffering from malnutrition, and lacking vital vitamins and minerals that their body needs to function can cause illness. Feeding your hamster a high-quality diet can help ensure they are as healthy as possible.  What Can Hamsters Eat FAQs Which human foods are safe for hamsters to eat? Generally, most food meant for humans should not be fed to your hamster. Raw, clean vegetables cut into bite-sized pieces are best. Fresh fruits and some seeds can also be given to your hamster occasionally as treats. Many foods that people eat are highly processed and can contain harmful ingredients, so it is best to avoid them. Which foods are toxic to hamsters? Some foods to be avoided are citrus fruits and spicy peppers, which can cause gastrointestinal problems for your hamster. Celery stalks can pose a danger to your hamster because their “strings” pose a choking hazard. Celery is also low in nutritional value, so it is not a good choice for a snack. Toxic foods including almonds, cherry pits, apple seeds, other fruit pits, and tomato leaves should also be avoided because they can have a toxic effect on your hamster. If you are unsure whether a specific food is safe for your hamster, it’s best to wait until you can check with your veterinarian.  WRITTEN BY Angelina Childree, LVT Veterinarian Technician Help us make PetMD better Was this article helpful?
