Faster and more efficient architecture. Cross-platform support for Windows and Linux. Vastly improved output quality. New GUI and installer for easy setup on Windows. Click to see more details üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Requirements Your system must meet the minimum hardware requirements below to run Video2X. CPU The precompiled binaries require CPUs with AVX2 support. Intel: Haswell (Q2 2013) or newer AMD: Excavator (Q2 2015) or newer GPU The GPU must support Vulkan. NVIDIA: Kepler (GTX 600 series, Q2 2012) or newer AMD: GCN 1.0 (Radeon HD 7000 series, Q1 2012) or newer Intel: HD Graphics 4000 (Q2 2012) or newer ü™ü Install on Windows Download the Latest Windows Installer Executable (6.4.0) You can download the latest Windows release on the releases page. For basic GUI usage, refer to the documentation. If you're unable to download directly from GitHub, try the mirror site. The GUI currently supports the following languages: English (United States) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠ÊñáÔºà‰∏≠ÂõΩÔºâ Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÔºàÊó•Êú¨Ôºâ Portugu√™s (Portugal) Fran√ßais (France) Deutsch (Deutschland) üêß Install on Linux Video2X packages are available for the Linux distros listed below. A universal AppImage is also available for other distros. If you'd like to build it from source code, refer to the PKGBUILD file for a general overview of the required dependencies and commands. Arch Linux: AUR packages, maintained by @K4YT3X. aur/video2x aur/video2x-git aur/video2x-qt6 aur/video2x-qt6-git Arch Linux (Chinese Mainland): archlinuxcn packages, maintained by @Integral-Tech. archlinuxcn/video2x archlinuxcn/video2x-git archlinuxcn/video2x-qt6 archlinuxcn/video2x-qt6-git Other distros: Video2X-x86_64.AppImage on the releases page. üì¶ Container Image Video2X container images are available on the GitHub Container Registry for easy deployment on Linux and macOS. If you already have Docker/Podman installed, only one command is needed to start upscaling a video. For more information on how to use Video2X's Docker image, please refer to the documentation. üìî Google Colab You can use Video2X on Google Colab for free if you don't have a powerful GPU of your own. You can borrow a powerful GPU (NVIDIA T4, L4, or A100) on Google's server for free for a maximum of 12 hours per session. Please use the free resource fairly and do not create sessions back-to-back and run upscaling 24/7. This might result in you getting banned. You can get Colab Pro/Pro+ if you'd like to use better GPUs and get longer runtimes. Usage instructions are embedded in the Colab Notebook. üí¨ Telegram Discussion Group Join our Telegram discussion group to ask any questions you have about Video2X, chat directly with the developers, or discuss super resolution, frame interpolation technologies, or the future of Video2X in general. üìñ Documentation Comprehensive documentation for Video2X is available at https://docs.video2x.org/. It offers detailed instructions on how to build, install, use, and develop with this program. üìΩÔ∏è Video Demos (Outdated) Upscale demo: Spirited Away's movie trailer Spirited Away: YouTube | Bilibili 360P to 4K The original video's copyright belongs to Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ„Çπ„Çø„Ç∏„Ç™„Ç∏„Éñ„É™ Bad Apple!!: YouTube | Bilibili 384P 30 FPS to 4K 120 FPS with waifu2x and DAIN The original video's copyright belongs to „ÅÇ„Å´„Çâ The Pet Girl of Sakurasou: YouTube | Bilibili 240P 29.97 to 1080P 60 FPS with waifu2x and DAIN The original video's copyright belongs to ASCII Media Works Standard Test Clip The following clip can be used to test if your setup works properly.
