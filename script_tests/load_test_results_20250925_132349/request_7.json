When planning a web scraping project, it’s important to balance technical, financial, and legal factors. See the top web scraping best practices for an ethical and successful web scraping: 1. Continuously parse and verify scraped data Parsed data needs to be continuously verified to ensure that crawling is working correctly. Data parsing can be left to the end of the crawl process but then users may fail to identify issues early on. We recommend automatically and at regular intervals manually verifying parsed data to ensure that the crawler and parser are working correctly. It would be disastrous to identify that you have scraped thousands of pages but the data is garbage. These problems take place when the source websites identify scraping bot traffic as unwanted traffic and serve misleading data to the bot. 2. Use proxies and rotate IP addresses For a reliable and cost-effective web data collection, you can use proxy services. The decision between residential and datacenter proxies is based on a number of variables that your tech staff is comfortable with, such as crawl time and proxy settings. You can use any proxy provider depending on their pricing if you are targeting easily crawled websites and don’t care about performance or scalability. See AIMultiple’s proxy pricing benchmark for additional information. Mobile proxies to get mobile responses. Web unblockers for hard-to-scrape pages that were not successfully retrieved by residential proxies. Websites use different anti-scraping techniques to manage web crawler traffic to their websites and protect themselves from malicious bot activity. Based on visitor activities and behaviors such as the number of pageviews, session duration, web servers can easily distinguish bot traffic from human activities. For example, many websites implement rate limiting, if you make too many requests frequently, you’ll receive HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests”.

Automate your web scraping project You can build your own web scraper or use a web scraping API to extract data from web sources: Building your scraper Python has a large number of web scraping libraries, for example, requests (for HTTP requests) and BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing) is a common starting point. For larger or more complex projects, you can leverage Scrapy that handles everything from requesting pages (sending multiple requests to one domain), following links, and parsing data. For smaller data extraction uses, BeautifulSoup is the go-to Python framework. Using a pre-built scraper There are numerous open-source and low/no-code web scrapers available. You can extract data from multiple websites without writing a single line of code. These web scrapers can be integrated as browser extensions to make web scraping tasks easier. If you have limited coding skills, low/no-code web scrapers could be extremely useful for your tasks. If you aim to scrape thousands or millions of pages from a well-protected website, you can leverage web scraping APIs that have built-in support for proxies and unblockers. Large websites have complex pagination system and employ anti-bot system. While deciding the right web scraping tool for your specific use case, you can follow these steps: Identify the target website. Although you intend to collect data from a single website, the target website can have different types of pages. For example, product detail pages can be different from a search results pages. Evaluate scraping API providers based on these capabilities. Check if the provider has prebuilt scrapers or actors for your specific site. Ask for sample output for your specific target page type to understand how the output is structured. Check out the success rate and response times of the top web scraping API solutions. 4. Check out the website to see if it supports an API APIs establish a data pipeline between clients and target websites in order to provide access to the content of the target website. You don’t have to worry about being blocked by the website since APIs provide authorized access to data. They are provided by the website you will extract data from. Therefore, you must first check out if an API is provided by the website. There are free and paid web scraping APIs you can utilize to access and get data from websites. Google Maps API, for example, adjusts pricing based on requester usage and volume of requests. Collecting data from websites via APIs is legal as long as the scraper follows the website’s API guidelines.  1 5.

Let’s dive in! Why Web Scraping Matters? Before diving into the best practices of web scraping, it’s worth taking a moment to understand its significance. Web scraping enables the automated extraction of information from websites, and it’s used across a wide array of industries: E-commerce: Businesses scrape competitor pricing, stock levels, and product descriptions to stay competitive. Marketing: Marketers use scraping to monitor social media sentiment, news coverage, and industry trends. Research: Academic researchers scrape data for analysis, especially in fields like economics, social sciences, and political studies. Real Estate: Aggregating property listings, rental prices, and property features from multiple sources. However, while scraping can provide massive benefits, it comes with technical challenges and ethical considerations. Improper scraping can cause servers to crash, violate terms of service, and result in legal repercussions. For this reason, it’s essential to approach scraping with caution and an understanding of best practices. Essential Do’s for Successful Web Scraping To set yourself up for success, it’s crucial to follow the key guidelines that can help you avoid common pitfalls, improve your scraper’s efficiency, and reduce the likelihood of getting blocked by your target website. Rotate IPs to Avoid Detection One of the simplest and most common anti-scraping mechanisms websites use is blocking IP addresses that generate too many requests within a short period. Over time, your scraper might get detected if you’re consistently making requests from the same IP, leading to an IP ban. To counter this, you should rotate IPs frequently. This can be achieved using a proxy service. Proxies act as intermediaries between your scraper and the website, masking your real IP and allowing you to appear as though the requests are coming from different sources. Rotating IPs: With a rotating proxy, each request gets routed through a different IP address, significantly reducing the chances of getting blocked. Proxy Pools: Alternatively, you can maintain a pool of proxies and select one at random for each request. Here’s a Python example of using proxies: import requests import random urls = [\"http://ident.me\"] # List of URLs proxy_list = [ \"54.37.160.88:1080\", \"18.222.22.12:3128\", # Add more proxy IPs ] for url in urls: proxy = random.choice(proxy_list) proxies = {\"http\": f\"http://{proxy}\", \"https\": f\"http://{proxy}\"} response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies) print(response.text) While free proxies might seem attractive, they often come with reliability issues and can be short-lived. For long-term scraping, consider investing in paid proxies or proxy rotation services to ensure consistency and minimize downtime. Rotate IPs to Avoid Detection with Bright Data Residential Proxies One of the best ways to avoid detection while web scraping is by using Bright Data’s Residential Proxies. These proxies provide access to a vast pool of real residential IPs, making your requests appear as if they’re coming from real users. Unlike free proxies, Bright Data’s proxies are highly reliable, fast, and optimized for web scraping. Why Use Residential Proxies? ✅ Automatic IP Rotation — Prevents detection and bans ✅ Access Geo-Restricted Content — Scrape data from any country ✅ High Success Rates — Works even on heavily protected websites Example using Bright Data’s Residential Proxies in Python: import requests proxy = \"http://username:password@brd.superproxy.io:22225\" proxies = {\"http\": proxy, \"https\": proxy} response = requests.get(\"https://example.com\", proxies=proxies) print(response.text) Bypass Anti-Bot Measures with Bright Data Web Unlocker Many websites implement anti-bot measures such as CAPTCHAs, JavaScript challenges, and IP blocking. Instead of manually handling these issues, you can use Bright Data’s Web Unlocker, which automatically bypasses these restrictions and ensures a high success rate for your web scraping tasks. Why Use Web Unlocker? ✅ Bypasses CAPTCHAs & Bot Protections — No manual solving required ✅ Handles Headers, Cookies & JavaScript Rendering — Ensures smooth scraping ✅ No Need for Manual Proxy Rotation — Works seamlessly with any target website Example using Web Unlocker in Python: import requests proxy = \"http://username:password@brd.superproxy.io:22225\" url = \"https://example.com\" response = requests.get(url, proxies={\"http\": proxy, \"https\": proxy}) print(response.text) Use Custom User-Agent Headers Many websites check the User-Agent header to identify the type of device or browser making a request. If they detect requests coming from non-browser clients (like cURL or a Python script), they may block the request, thinking it’s a bot. A simple solution to this is to customize the User-Agent header. The User-Agent string typically includes details about the browser, operating system, and device. By using a legitimate User-Agent from a modern browser, you can make your scraper appear more like a typical user. Tip: It’s also a good idea to rotate User-Agent strings just as you rotate IPs, as sending the same one repeatedly can also raise flags.
