Why does MCP matter? Start Building Learn more Get started What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)? Copy page MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can connect to data sources (e.g. local files, databases), tools (e.g. search engines, calculators) and workflows (e.g. specialized prompts)—enabling them to access key information and perform tasks. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to external systems. ​ What can MCP enable? Agents can access your Google Calendar and Notion, acting as a more personalized AI assistant. Claude Code can generate an entire web app using a Figma design. Enterprise chatbots can connect to multiple databases across an organization, empowering users to analyze data using chat. AI models can create 3D designs on Blender and print them out using a 3D printer. ​ Why does MCP matter? Depending on where you sit in the ecosystem, MCP can have a range of benefits. Developers: MCP reduces development time and complexity when building, or integrating with, an AI application or agent. AI applications or agents: MCP provides access to an ecosystem of data sources, tools and apps which will enhance capabilities and improve the end-user experience. End-users: MCP results in more capable AI applications or agents which can access your data and take actions on your behalf when necessary. ​ Start Building Build servers Create MCP servers to expose your data and tools Build clients Develop applications that connect to MCP servers ​ Learn more Understand concepts Learn the core concepts and architecture of MCP Was this page helpful?

It enables AI models to seamlessly connect with external tools and data sources without requiring custom integrations for each platform. By serving as a universal protocol, MCP ensures that AI applications can access real-time, contextually relevant data in a secure, scalable and efficient way. Unified Connectivity: MCP standardizes the communication layer between AI systems and data sources, removing the need for repetitive, service-specific integrations. Real-Time Access: It enables AI models to utilize the most up-to-date information, enhancing accuracy and decision-making. Simplified Integration: Developers can integrate MCP with minimal setup, improving scalability and reducing time-to-deploy. Cross-Industry Impact: From enterprise workflows to healthcare and customer support, MCP supports a wide range of AI-powered use cases. MCP Architecture MCP Architecture MCP's architecture is designed to be both simple and flexible which helps in enabling good interaction between AI models and various data sources. It works by connecting three key components: MCP Servers, MCP Clients and MCP Hosts. 1. MCP Servers External service that executes actions or provides data based on client requests. Transforms structured user queries into server-side operations, enabling LLMs to access data and tools. MCP servers are commonly available as GitHub repositories (C#, Java, TypeScript, Python, etc.), often with tutorials to aid developers. Servers can also connect to LLM inference platforms (e.g., IBM, OpenAI) through the MCP SDK, exposing them as standardized, reusable chat services. Integration examples: Slack, GitHub, Git, Docker, web search engines. Versatility: MCP servers support both internal resources (databases, files) and external services (APIs, cloud tools). MCP servers expose data through: Resources: Fetch information from internal or external databases (returns data only, no computation). Tools: Connect with APIs or systems that can perform side effects such as calculations, queries or data actions. Prompts: Provide reusable workflows and structured templates that standardize LLM-to-server communication. 2. MCP Clients Acts as the communication bridge between the host and server. Converts user requests into structured MCP protocol messages that servers can process. A host can contain multiple clients, but each client has a dedicated 1:1 connection to one server. MCP clients also manage sessions, including handling interruptions, timeouts, reconnections and closures. Clients parse responses, perform error handling and verify that outputs remain relevant to the given context. Examples: IBM® BeeAI, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Claude.ai, Windsurf Editor and Postman. 3. MCP Hosts The integration layer where the user interacts with the AI application. Examples include Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE and other AI-enabled interfaces. Hosts contain the orchestration logic needed to connect multiple clients with multiple servers. They handle coordination, manage workflows and ensure that requests flow correctly between clients and servers. Use of MCP in Agent Workflow When building AI agents, there are usually three types of context they need to handle: Ephemeral turn context: This is the current prompt and any notes retrieved during that interaction. It is temporary and discarded after the task is done. Session or task context: This is information that lasts throughout a multi-step process, like to-do lists or temporary files used during a job. Long-term memory: These are permanent facts and data related to a user or workspace that the agent can remember and use over time. MCP helps manage all these different types of context clearly and efficiently by: Exposing memory through MCP tools or resources, such as search and update functions (memory.search, memory.upsert) or URLs like resource:/memory/<userId>. Allowing multiple agents or applications to connect to the same memory server, so they can share and reuse context easily. Providing centralized control through authentication, access permissions and auditing to keep shared context secure and well-managed. Step-by-Step Implementation As we saw earlier the uses of MCP in agent workflow, lets see a detailed working of to understand better. In the below give workflow we can see, User sends input: The user submits a query or command to the system. Client forwards input: The client application passes this input to the server. Server requests agent response: The server calls MCP to process the request using MCP.bot.ask(). MCP manages context: MCP plays a crucial role by adding the user input to its context memory. This step ensures that both the current prompt and relevant historical or session data are available for accurate processing. MCP requests AI response: MCP sends the contextualized prompt to the external AI service (OpenAI) for generating a response. AI response returned: OpenAI returns the generated answer to MCP. MCP updates context: MCP logs the AI’s response in its context memory so that ongoing or future interactions can benefit from this knowledge, supporting both session continuity and long-term memory. Server delivers response: The completed response is relayed back through the server and client to the user for display.
